## Usage Guidelines

- The `src/vikatht.js` file contains the logic for fetching card data and displaying it in the DOM. Ensure that the API endpoints used in this file are accessible.
- You can add static assets (like images) in the `src/assets` directory.
- Reusable components can be created and stored in the `src/components` directory for better organization and maintainability.
